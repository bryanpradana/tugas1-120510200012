            A New Era

            Today, the JDM category is much different than what it was several decades ago. 
            In the early 2000s, the cars were what we'd describe as "ricers" today - full of underglow, horrid body kits, and ugly exterior mods. 
            Thankfully, though, that faded away and was replaced with a new era of JDM.
