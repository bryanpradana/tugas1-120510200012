            What is JDM? The Real Story Behind Japanese Domestic Market Cars.
        </h1>

        <div>
            No matter if you're an automotive guru or a novice enthusiast, you've definitely heard the term "JDM" at least once before.
            <br>
            It stands for "Japanese Domestic Market" and refers to cars that were made by Japanese companies, obeying the country's regulations.
            <br>
            Simple enough. But, Japan is a country like any other, 
            <br>

            <br>
            To best understand how Japanese automotive culture made its way to the states, we must first examine what everyone stateside is so obsessed over. 
            <br>
            During the 1980s, Japanese manufacturers started making superb sports cars. 
            <br>
            Examples include the Toyota AE86, original GT-R/Skylines, etc. Not long afterwards, motorsports like <span1>drifting</span1> made their way into the spotlight in Asia.
