            As we teased earlier, getting an awesome JDM car to the States is no easy task, especially for those that do not meet the 25-year requirement. 
            "What is the 25-year requirement?" you may be asking. Well, here's the gist: cars that are deemed "illegal" by the United States government are not allowed to be brought to the United States 
            UNLESS they are over 25-years old; meeting the qualifications for an "antique" car.
