            I'll let you read an article about the GR Supra for this one
        </h1>

            Motor Trend had reported that a possible Supra successor could be based on the FT-HS (Future Toyota Hybrid Sport), which debuted at the 2007 North American International Auto Show. The publication also reported that the fifth generation of the Supra could be powered by a 3.5-litre V-6 hybrid system rated at over 298 kW (400 hp; 405 PS). Toyota quoted that it was not rushing for the Supra successor but instead was waiting to see how the sales of the GT86/FR-S went. 
            In 2010, Toyota applied for a trademark for the Supra name. The trademark had to be used within three years for it to be valid. In December 2011, Autoguide reported a possible Supra replacement would be positioned above the GT86. Tetsuya Tada, the chief engineer of the Toyota 86/Scion FR-S told reporters in Germany in 2012 "the president (Akio Toyoda) has asked me to make a successor to the Supra as soon as possible. 
            In late 2013, AutoBlog reported a concept for a proposed successor to the Supra would be making its debut the January 2014 North American International Auto Show. On 13 January, Toyota unveiled its new FT-1 concept car. Little technical detail was disclosed about this new concept car; other than that it has a front engine and rear wheel drive layout. Toyota also stated that their new concept car draws inspiration from Toyota's past sports cars like the 2000GT, Supra, MR-2 and 2007 FT-HS concept car. Toyota did not state whether the FT-1 would use the Supra name, or if it was even bound for production.
