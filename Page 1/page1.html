        <p>
            Japanese Domestic Market is a term they use for vehicles and parts designed to conform to Japanese regulations and to suit Japanese buyers.
            <br>
            The term is abbreviated as JDM.
            <br>
            A very common misunderstanding of the term is the false belief that JDM means Japanese produced vehicle. This is however untrue. 
            <br>
            A vehicle being manufactured in Japan does not make a vehicle JDM.
            <br>
            JDM specifically means a vehicle that was produced with the intent of being sold in Japan, and not outside of the country.
