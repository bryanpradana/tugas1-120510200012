            Importing Japanâ€™s Forbidden Models
        </div>
        <div class="fancy">
            Some enthusiasts go to great lengths, and often considerable expense, to find cars in Japan to import, even flouting the law to do so. 
            Others take a similar American-market model and transform it into the Japanese equivalent part by part, 
            even if the difference is apparent only to aficionados.
